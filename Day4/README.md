## HELM
- package manager for Kubernetes/OpenShift
- it helps us in packaging(bundling) all the manifest files that are required for an application deployment in a single package
- the HELM packages are called charts
- using HELM you can install,uninstall,update, upgrade your application
- this is similar to apt for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS or npm for nodejs
